/**
 * Question 2
 * Search in a bitonic array. 
 * An array is bitonic if it is comprised of an increasing sequence of integers followed immediately by a decreasing sequence of integers. 
 * Write a program that, given a bitonic array of N distinct integer values, determines whether a given integer is in the array.

 * Signing bonus: Use ∼2lgN compares in the worst case (and prove that no algorithm can guarantee to perform fewer than 
 * ∼2lgN compares in the worst case).
 * 
 * Given a bitonic array, if we cut it into half by mid, then there are only 2 possibilities:
 * <ul>
 * <li> a monotonically increasing left half, and a bitonic right half </li>
 * <li> a bitonic left half, and a monotonically decreasing right half. So
 * <ul><li> If target > a[mid], we only need to search the bitonic half (i.e. the half where MAX lies)</li>
 * <li> If target < a[mid], target can appear in either left or right half: </li>
 *    <ul><li>For left half, we do ascending binary search (= binary search of an ascending array) </li>
 *    <li>For right half, we do descending binary search (= binary search of an descending array) </li>
 * <li>I think in this case we don't care about the "bitonic part" in the left half and right half, since
 * elements in this part would be larger than a[mid], so even larger than the target. 
 * So although its still a bitonic subarray, we can treat it as a sorted array and do binary search. </li></ul> 
 *</ul>
 * <p> "it might be surprising to do a binary search on a subarray that may be bitonic but it actually works 
 * because we know that the elements that are not in the good order are all bigger than the desired value."

 * <p>
 * "If a is bitonic in the range [lo,hi), then we can divide up the range into [lo, k), [k, peak), [peak, hi) 
 * where k is the first index with a[k] > a[hi].  We know the answer can only fall into the first region, [lo,k)"
